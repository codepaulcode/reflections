When would you want to create a remote respository rather than keep all your work local?

You might want to collaborate with others on a project or share code. 
It's also useful for editing code from multiple computers. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually, 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because this provides more control over when the code changes, 
which might not be desireable at a given time because of bugs. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used for cloning repositories on GitHub servers, cloning is making a local copy of a repo,
either from a local source or github, and branches are part of a single repository. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

If I had too, I might take to using some kind of shared folder or file system like Dropbox, or Google docs. 
This would probably be harder than GitHub in the sense of tracking changes and locating bugs. 
It woud be eaiser in the sense of having a less complicated setup. 


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?

It would make sense when a group or large number of people are working on the same project. 
The beenfit being keeping track of all the changes that have already been made or approved for 
merging with master.
